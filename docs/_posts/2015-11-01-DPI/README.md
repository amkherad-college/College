I completed my bachelorâ€™s (degree) program in `Software Engineering` at `DPI` college.


The most remarkable projects I've worked on was:
* [ShellScript](https://github.com/amkherad/ShellScript)
   * A cross-platform intermediate shell scripting language (transpiler).
* An OCR to detect English and Persian handwriting.
   * I developed a pattern-recognition algorithm to convert images or handwritten paths into text.
